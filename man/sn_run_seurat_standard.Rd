\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class Seurat, representing single-cell RNA-seq
data.}

\item{nfeatures}{Use this many features as variable features after ranking by
residual variance; default is 3000. Only applied if residual.features is
not set.}

\item{vars_to_regress}{Variables to regress out in a second non-regularized
linear regression. For example, percent.mito. Default is NULL.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print messages and progress bars.}

\value{
Seurat object after applying the standard workflow.
