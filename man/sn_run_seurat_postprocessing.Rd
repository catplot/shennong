\usage{
sn_run_seurat_postprocessing(
  object,
  reduction = "pca",
  dims = 1:30,
  resolution = 0.8,
  seed = 717,

\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class Seurat, representing single-cell RNA-seq
data.}

\item{reduction}{Reduction to use as input for building the (S)NN.}

\item{dims}{Dimensions of reduction to use as input.}

\item{resolution}{Value of the resolution parameter, use a value above
(below) 1.0 if you want to obtain a larger (smaller) number of communities.}

\item{seed}{Set a random seed. By default, sets the seed to 1448145. Setting
NULL will not set a seed.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print messages and progress bars.}

\item{run_tsne}{Whether to run t-SNE reduction.}
}
\value{
Seurat object after post-processing.
