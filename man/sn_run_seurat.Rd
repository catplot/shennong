\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class Seurat, representing single-cell RNA-seq
data.}

\item{assay}{Name of assay to fetch layer data from or assign layer data to.}

\item{workflow}{The workflow to use. Can be either "standard" or
"sctransform".}

\item{nfeatures}{Use this many features as variable features after ranking by
residual variance; default is 3000. Only applied if residual.features is
not set.}

\item{vars_to_regress}{Variables to regress out in a second non-regularized
linear regression. For example, percent.mito. Default is NULL.}

\item{vst_flavor}{When set to 'v2' sets method = glmGamPoi_offset,
n_cells=2000, and exclude_poisson = TRUE which causes the model to learn
theta and intercept only besides excluding poisson genes from learning and
regularization.}

\item{reduction}{Reduction to use as input for building the (S)NN.}

\item{batch}{Attribute for batch.}

\item{integration_method}{Integration method. Can be either "harmony", "mnn",
"cca", "rpca", or "scvi".}

\item{dims}{Dimensions of reduction to use as input.}

\item{resolution}{Value of the resolution parameter, use a value above
(below) 1.0 if you want to obtain a larger (smaller) number of communities.}

\item{seed}{Set a random seed. By default, sets the seed to 1448145. Setting
NULL will not set a seed.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print messages and progress bars.}

\item{run_tsne}{Whether to run t-SNE reduction.}

\item{cell_cycle_scoring}{Whether to score cell cycle phases.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to other methods.}
}
\value{
An updated Seurat object after performing the specified workflow and
  post-processing.
}
\description{
Executes a Seurat workflow for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis. Supports
both standard and SCTransform workflows, followed by PCA reduction and
post-processing.
